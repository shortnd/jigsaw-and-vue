# jigsaw-and-vue

This is a little side project that I am going to do over the course of the next few weeks, inorder to figure out how I want to start making static sites

## Todo's

[] Get Vue and Jigsaw to work
[] See about implementing Vue Router
[] Have all page render like Server Side or just static site builder like Nuxt, where Vue will take over once its loaded
